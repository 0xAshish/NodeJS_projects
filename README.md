nodejs ,mongodb based contact book type app 
# _ajax version is API + Single page application kind of app 
which uses jquery and json request to build content of html page dynamically 
(it uses less network and we can use this for mobile app or website both using api / backend part )

(uses more network and slower then ajax version)
